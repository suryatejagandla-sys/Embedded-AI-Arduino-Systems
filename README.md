# Embedded AI & Microcontroller Systems (Arduino)

This repository contains implementations of resource-efficient algorithms and hardware interfacing on the Arduino (AVR/ARM) platform.

## Project Focus
- **Edge Inference:** Deploying lightweight logic for real-time sensor data processing.
- **Hardware Interfacing:** Low-level communication using I2C, SPI, and UART protocols.
- **Memory Optimization:** Managing limited SRAM and Flash memory for continuous operation.

## Key Technical Concepts
- **Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs):** Used for time-critical sensor polling.
- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM):** For precise control of actuators/LEDs.
- **Power Management:** Implementing sleep modes to optimize energy consumption.

## Relevance to C-DAC
My work here demonstrates proficiency in the "Hardware-Software Co-design" paradigm, which is central to C-DAC’s mission in indigenous embedded system development.# Machine Learning on Arduino
